A new report on the fallout from that investigation finds this dark ad tech industry is far more resilient and incestuous than previously known. Image: Infoblox. In November 2024, researchers at the security firm Qurium published an investigation into \u201cDoppelganger,\u201d a disinformation network that promotes pro-Russian narratives and infiltrates Europe\u2019s media landscape by pushing fake news through a network of cloned websites. Doppelganger campaigns use specialized links that bounce the visitor\u2019s browser through a long series of domains before the fake news content is served. Qurium found Doppelganger relies on a sophisticated \u201cdomain cloaking\u201d service, a technology that allows websites to present different content to search engines compared to what regular visitors see. The use of cloaking services helps the disinformation sites remain online longer than they otherwise would, while ensuring that only the targeted audience gets to view the intended content. Qurium discovered that Doppelganger\u2019s cloaking service also promoted online dating sites, and shared much of the same infrastructure with VexTrio, which is thought to be the oldest malicious traffic distribution system (TDS) in existence. While TDSs are commonly used by legitimate advertising networks to manage traffic from disparate sources and to track who or what is behind each click, VexTrio\u2019s TDS largely manages web traffic from victims of phishing, malware, and social engineering scams. BREAKING BAD Digging deeper, Qurium noticed Doppelganger\u2019s cloaking service used an Internet provider in Switzerland as the first entry point in a chain of domain redirections. They also noticed the same infrastructur",
